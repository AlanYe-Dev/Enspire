As the new leader of the club, i told my members about the origin of the martial art.The origin of martial arts can be traced back to the primitive society. At that time, humans began to fight with the wild beasts with original tools such as sticks! First, in order to defend themselves, one was to hunt for living materials. Later, in order to compete for wealth, people created more lethal weapons. For example, in the \"Shan Hai Jing Great Wilderness North\", there is a record of \"Wu You are a soldier in the Yellow Emperor\". such! Through fighting, human beings not only created weapons, but also gradually accumulated skills with certain offensive and defensive meanings. Martial arts belong to traditional Chinese techniques. It is to kick, hit, fall, and take. Strike, stab and other martial arts actions are the main content, and the ability to attack and defend fighting is demonstrated by the physical movement of the hand or the instrument. Whether it is a confrontational capture movement or a routine of generations, the traditional Chinese techniques are the core of technology. As far as human social life is concerned, martial arts cannot be unique to China. Compared with martial arts around the world, martial arts is not only rich in martial arts methods, but also contains rich cultural connotations and health effects that other martial arts do not have."}], "projectyes": 1}, {"groups": [{"C_GroupsID": "144", "C_GroupNo": "100017", "C_NameC": "\u5f08\u8bed\u68cb\u658b", "C_NameE": "Go & Chinese Chess club", "C_CategoryID": "1", "C_Category": "Sports", "C_TypeC": null, "C_TypeA": null, "C_TypeS": null, "C_FoundTime": "2018-09-04 16:20:10", "C_DescriptionC": "\u5f08\u8bed\u68cb\u658b\u539f\u540d\u56f4\u68cb\u793e\uff0c\u75312017\u7ea7\u5b66\u957f\u4f55\u4e00\u591a\u3001\u859b\u8a3e\u4e30\u521b\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u56f4\u68cb\u90e8\u3002\u8c61\u68cb\u90e8\u7531\u989c\u7a1a\u8f69\u540c\u5b66\u521b\u5efa\u4e8e2019\u5e74\u3002\n\u672c\u793e\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u540c\u5b66\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u68cb\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4e3a\u68cb\u7c7b\u7231\u597d\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5207\u78cb\u68cb\u827a\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68cb\u827a\u3002\n\u65e5\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\u6709\u5bf9\u5f08\u3001\u590d\u76d8\u3001\u505a\u9898\u7b49\u3002\u82e5\u53c2\u52a0\u4eba\u6570\u8db3\u591f\uff0c\u4f1a\u4ee3\u8868\u5b66\u6821\u5916\u51fa\u6bd4\u8d5b\u3002\n\u83b7\u5f97\u56e2\u4f53\u5956\u9879\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c4a\u4e0a\u6d77\u540d\u6821\u56f4\u68cb\u8054\u8d5b \u51a0\u519b\n\n\u6d3b\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\uff1a\n\u56f4\u68cb\u90e8\uff1a\u6bcf\u5468\u4e9416:00~18:00\n\u8c61\u68cb\u90e8\uff1a\u6bcf\u5468\u4e9416:00~17:30", "C_DescriptionE": "Go & Chinese Chess  club\uff08former name: Go club\uff09 was founded by He Yiduo and Xue Zifeng, students of Class 2020.

People who suffer from disabilities or still are not able to read therefore are lack of reading resources. It\u2019s worthwhile for us pay more attention on the development of audio books and help them.

Many students at our school will be heading towards an international direction, so it is important that they learn as much about colleges as possible. Unfortunately, this is a time consuming process. Our club will research these colleges and then give this information to students. We will also be contacting school admission councilors in international schools and inviting them to our school to speak. We hope to create more student-councilor interaction and create a more entertaining and creative way for councilors to present the information about their school.  We will also be striving to create more people-friendly ways to interact with the councilors even with a tight schedule.Secondly, we also help students in CAS activities. To those students who are new to the international campus, they have to choose their clubs on the second week of the new semester.

I first introduced the way pictures are stored in the computer, and then introduced the concept of convolution. I then carefully explained the convolutional layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer and softmax layer in CNN with examples. At the same time, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is another important neural network variant. Its structure enables it to process sequence data. I first introduced the architecture of the recurrent neural network, combined with basic translation tasks to explain the specific process of forward propagation and reverse derivation. Later, I analyzed its shortcomings and introduced the unique architecture of sequence to sequence (seq2seq), the more complex RNN Cell of LSTM network, and the improved method of bidirectional RNN. After this class, I have a better understanding of how to explain various complex concepts in a simple way and expand the knowledge of students.\nBefore the lecture, I spent approximately 2 hours finding all the diagrams and math information about cnn and rnn.

We believed that the children in Dabie Mountain are not in the extreme lack of financial support, but instead, the need for more open-minded ideas and thoughts, and that is the weakness we saw in the education there. We mainly designed three projects that are online teaching-assistance, the love mailbox and also the self-designed book \u2018For the Young Readers\u2019. In this way, we want to expand the children\u2019s outlook and help them to build their own new attitude towards life.

We also have discussion on the topic to help less fortunate. \n"}], "projectyes": 1}, {"groups": [{"C_GroupsID": "132", "C_GroupNo": "200032", "C_NameC": "JOL\u60a6\u4e60\u793e", "C_NameE": "JOL", "C_CategoryID": "2", "C_Category": "Service", "C_TypeC": null, "C_TypeA": null, "C_TypeS": null, "C_FoundTime": "2017-10-20 20:50:46", "C_DescriptionC": "JOL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5b66\u751f\u81ea\u4e3b\u53d1\u8d77\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u66fe\u88ab\u8bc4\u4e3a\u4e0a\u6d77\u5e02\u4e16\u754c\u5916\u56fd\u8bed\u4e2d\u5b66\u7684\u4e94\u661f\u793e\u56e2\uff0c\u6d3b\u52a8\u5185\u5bb9\u5747\u4e3a\u975e\u76c8\u5229\u7684\u516c\u76ca\u9879\u76ee\u3002\u81f3\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u66fe\u5f00\u8fc7\u4f17\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u4e0d\u540c\u3001\u9762\u5411\u5404\u4e2a\u5e74\u9f84\u6bb5\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u7ef4\u3001\u516c\u5171\u6f14\u8bb2\u3001\u620f\u5267\u3001\u82f1\u8bed\u97f3\u6807\u7b49\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u62e5\u6709\u8f7b\u677e\u7684\u793e\u56e2\u6c1b\u56f4\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u6000\u62b1\u7740\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u70ed\u5ff1\uff0c\u6e34\u671b\u628a\u5fc3\u4e2d\u7684\u70ed\u7231\u4f20\u64ad\u7ed9\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4eba\u3002", "C_DescriptionE": "JOL is an educational organization independently initiated by high school students.

He started from introducing what is a good interview with an example, then he started to share important tips on how to raise a question to the interviewee and to continue the conversation by going much deeper. Several members raised questions that they encountered when doing the interview this semester, which was gold to see as it showed that they were reflecting on their works. Mr.Yu discussed with them together to find solutions to the problem so that they can do better next time. The course was overall helpful and interesting as Mr.Yu shared lots of personal anecdotes and the contents are relevant and useful."}], "projectyes": 1}, {"groups": [{"C_GroupsID": "164", "C_GroupNo": "200036", "C_NameC": "\u5b66\u751f\u52a9\u7406\u56e2", "C_NameE": "", "C_CategoryID": "2", "C_Category": "Service", "C_TypeC": null, "C_TypeA": null, "C_TypeS": null, "C_FoundTime": "2018-10-08 12:39:32", "C_DescriptionC": "", "C_DescriptionE": ""}], "supervisor": [{"TeacherID": "466", "T_Name": "\u5b59\u9038\u747e", "T_Nickname": "Cindy", "T_MTel": null, "T_Email": null}], "gmember": [{"StudentID": "5384", "S_Name": "\u90ed\u53ef\u6069", "S_Nickname": "Karen", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5187", "S_Name": "\u5f20\u4e4b\u6657", "S_Nickname": "Hans Zhang", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5732", "S_Name": "\u5f20\u516c\u9a8f", "S_Nickname": "Eric", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5711", "S_Name": "\u9648\u5609\u6021", "S_Nickname": "Jaquene", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5632", "S_Name": "\u738b\u611a\u8bda", "S_Nickname": "Jack", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5840", "S_Name": "\u5b59\u5929\u704f", "S_Nickname": "Thomas", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5172", "S_Name": "\u8463\u59ae", "S_Nickname": "Valasta", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5815", "S_Name": "\u9c81\u6021\u6668", "S_Nickname": "Clementine", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4488", "S_Name": "\u9648\u4fde\u679c", "S_Nickname": "Cane", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5576", "S_Name": "\u9f9a\u695a\u6dc7", "S_Nickname": "Alyssa", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}], "grecord": [], "projectyes": 1}, {"groups": [{"C_GroupsID": "15", "C_GroupNo": "219037", "C_NameC": "WFLA\u5b66\u751f\u516c\u53f8", "C_NameE": "WFLA Student Firm", "C_CategoryID": "2", "C_Category": "Service", "C_TypeC": "0", "C_TypeA": "0", "C_TypeS": "0", "C_FoundTime": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "C_DescriptionC": "\u5b66\u751f\u516c\u53f8\u4e8e2012\u5e74\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u793e\u56e2\u793e\u957f\u4e00\u4f4d\uff0c\u526f\u793e\u957f\u4e24\u4f4d\u3002\u5b66\u751f\u516c\u53f8\u81f3\u4eca\u5df2\u5f00\u5c55\u591a\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u2014\u2014\u4ece\u201c\u6821\u670d\u718a \u201d\u9879\u76ee\u81f3\u201cBeary Pod\u201d\u9879\u76ee\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u79c9\u7740\u6c38\u8fdc\u8ffd\u6c42\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e0d\u65ad\u62d3\u5bbd\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002 \u516c\u53f8\u7684\u7406\u5ff5\u4e3a\u201c\u521b\u610f\u6148\u5584\u201d\uff0c\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u201c\u793e\u4f1a\u578b\u4f01\u4e1a\u201d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u5b66\u751f\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u4ee5\u5546\u4e1a\u4e3a\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u96c6\u4e2d\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d44\u52a9\u6148\u5584\u673a\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56de\u9988\u793e\u4f1a\u3002", "C_DescriptionE": "Two firm directors establish WFLMS student firm in 2012.

Eventually, you will find that instead of being like lonely the stars far away over the rainbow, they are stars under the rainbow, casting a thousand beams \u2013 all they need is just a little more tolerance, patience, and time."}], "supervisor": [{"TeacherID": "352", "T_Name": "\u738b\u68a6\u598d", "T_Nickname": "Catherine", "T_MTel": null, "T_Email": null}], "gmember": [{"StudentID": "5413", "S_Name": "\u536b\u5929\u4e00", "S_Nickname": "Terrence", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "sunxia2727@163.com", "LeaderYes": "2", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4498", "S_Name": "\u66f9\u6587\u8431", "S_Nickname": "Vivian", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "1", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5223", "S_Name": "\u9648\u5f66\u5b89", "S_Nickname": "Ian Chen", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5294", "S_Name": "\u59dc\u541b", "S_Nickname": "Michael", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4469", "S_Name": "\u5b59\u5b87\u6d69", "S_Nickname": "Jack", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4449", "S_Name": "\u5468\u601d\u5a9b", "S_Nickname": "Teresa", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4638", "S_Name": "\u9ad8\u665f\u8fdc", "S_Nickname": "Geoffrey", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5085", "S_Name": "\u7fc1\u777f\u5947", "S_Nickname": "Ricky", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5170", "S_Name": "\u90d1\u597d", "S_Nickname": "Airanar", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5568", "S_Name": "\u9ec4\u4e91\u8431", "S_Nickname": "Emily", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5888", "S_Name": "\u91d1\u5f66\u8fb0", "S_Nickname": "Ethan", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5591", "S_Name": "\u7f57\u5b87\u77f3", "S_Nickname": "Stevie", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5688", "S_Name": "\u738b\u777f\u6db5", "S_Nickname": "Olivia", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5609", "S_Name": "\u674e\u94ed\u54f2", "S_Nickname": "Tony", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5573", "S_Name": "\u9ad8\u97f5\u537f", "S_Nickname": "Yolanda", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5691", "S_Name": "\u5f20\u9526\u6021", "S_Nickname": "Ida", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5673", "S_Name": "\u4f55\u5955\u626c", "S_Nickname": "Steve", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5886", "S_Name": "\u9648\u601d\u777f", "S_Nickname": "Cedric", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5825", "S_Name": "\u8463\u5b89\u5947", "S_Nickname": "Angel", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5106", "S_Name": "\u5f20\u4fee\u9f50", "S_Nickname": "Hugh", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4630", "S_Name": "\u94b1\u6a59", "S_Nickname": "Cheng", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5132", "S_Name": "\u5468\u6da6\u5982", "S_Nickname": "Runru", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5225", "S_Name": "\u738b\u4e50\u8005", "S_Nickname": "Peter", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}], "grecord": [{"C_Theme": "The first voluntary activity to stay with autism children ", "C_Date": "2023-06-28 00:00:00", "C_Reflection": "This activity actually happened in the afternoon of March 21, 2023.

She shared some of her opinions on science-fiction, and showed a paragraph written by Cixin Liu. Then she read her story. I thought it was beautifully written. She wrote about an astronaut who grew in a world with a force called \u201cdexter force\u201d, and after the astronaut broke the record of space-travelling and arrived at a planet when forces completely balanced with each other, she realized how beautiful this equilibrium was.

After I discussed with the leaders of the poetry society of YK Pao, we decided to increase the type of contribution. This year we are also going to collect poem translation, poem recitation, and poem calligraphic work besides original poems. The main issue is that whether we should ask contributors of other types of work create their work based on the showcase competing poems, or they can select their own poems to translate, recite and write.

Finally, we decided to make an imitation of the article of Luxun's work and it was a great of success."}], "projectyes": 1}], "Academic": [{"groups": [{"C_GroupsID": "1", "C_GroupNo": "500001", "C_NameC": "\u5386\u53f2\u793e", "C_NameE": "History Club", "C_CategoryID": "5", "C_Category": "Academic", "C_TypeC": "0", "C_TypeA": "0", "C_TypeS": "0", "C_FoundTime": "0000-00-00 00:00:00", "C_DescriptionC": "\u5386\u53f2\u793e\u575a\u6301\u4ee5\u5386\u53f2\u4e3a\u4e3b\u3001\u5176\u4f59\u6587\u79d1\u4e3a\u8f85\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u7ed9\u6240\u6709\u793e\u5458\u5e26\u6765\u5171\u540c\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u5feb\u4e50\u3002\u672c\u793e\u9664\u4e86\u4ee5\u8bb2\u5ea7\u4e3a\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u6d3b\u52a8\u5916\uff0c\u4ea6\u6709\u8bf8\u591a\u5206\u4eab\u5f0f\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u6587\u884c\u8d70\u3001\u51fb\u5251\u3001\u8fa9\u8bba\u3001\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u7b49\uff09\u3002\u5386\u53f2\u793e\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u516c\u4f17\u53f7\u66f4\u662f\u6bcf\u4e00\u4f4d\u793e\u5458\u521b\u9020\u3001\u953b\u70bc\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u662f\u793e\u56e2\u9762\u5411\u5927\u4f17\u5206\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u3002\u5386\u53f2\u793e\u8fd8\u65f6\u5e38\u7ed3\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u54f2\u5b66\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u7b49\uff09\u62d3\u5c55\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u89c6\u91ce\u3002\u7b80\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0c\u5386\u53f2\u793e\u662f\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u793e\u79d1\u7231\u597d\u8005\u7684\u4e0d\u4e8c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "C_DescriptionE": "The History Club adheres to an activity strategy that emphasizes history and complements other liberal arts in order to provide its members the joy of collective advancement.

However,MUN/DEBATE club is not only about MUNs and debates; it is more of an attitude, an attitude of constantly caring, thinking, and presenting with confidence. Neither is MUN/DEBATE club all about academic activities: we periodically play a game called \u201cDiplomacy\u201d in order for members to develop abilities to strategize with regard to international relations.

We provide the chance for students studying French to read proper French story books, to create a French corner, to express own thoughts about French, etc. Familiarizing with French culture is another important process of learning French. In our school, there are plenty of students who are totally fascinated by French culture. In order to know France better, we will advertise French culture by combining our French salon inside school with activities organized by Shanghai French Alliance outside school. We tentatively decide to set one theme per month. Club members will preview the theme of the month by reading, watching movies, having snacks, etc. During the every-week sharing time, we will then discuss the theme in groups. We will also offer site visits once a month according to the plan. We plan to show our activities and members\u2019 learning experience by designing posters and writing some articles on wechat at the end of the first semester."}], "supervisor": [{"TeacherID": "395", "T_Name": "\u502a\u601d\u9065", "T_Nickname": "Ni", "T_MTel": null, "T_Email": null}], "gmember": [{"StudentID": "5216", "S_Name": "\u90ed\u5e7f\u5b87", "S_Nickname": "Aaron", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "2", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5172", "S_Name": "\u8463\u59ae", "S_Nickname": "Valasta", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "1", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5623", "S_Name": "\u9648\u82cf\u9e23", "S_Nickname": "Michelle", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4562", "S_Name": "\u6234\u5706\u65b9", "S_Nickname": "Chloe", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5193", "S_Name": "\u9ec4\u4e50\u7f18", "S_Nickname": "Luna", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5733", "S_Name": "\u66fe\u7fca\u94ed", "S_Nickname": "Tom", "S_STel": null, "S_Email": null, "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5707", "S_Name": "\u5f20\u60a6\u7eb3", "S_Nickname": "Ariel", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5617", "S_Name": "\u738b\u601d\u777f", "S_Nickname": "Ella", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4592", "S_Name": "\u5434\u79b9\u537f", "S_Nickname": "Rosy", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4599", "S_Name": "\u674e\u6cca\u5b81", "S_Nickname": "Byron", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4594", "S_Name": "\u9648\u8bfa\u8473", "S_Nickname": "Novi", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}], "grecord": [{"C_Theme": "Learning resource", "C_Date": "2023-01-06 00:00:00", "C_Reflection": "10/27 \nThis meeting was an online meeting because all the student were at home quarantine.

In the end, we hope that every single experienced club member would say that, as long as they engage in debates, they know for a fact that they are debaters, and their passion and enthusiasm for debate is never going to end.\n\n"}], "supervisor": [{"TeacherID": "465", "T_Name": "William Sheehy", "T_Nickname": "William", "T_MTel": null, "T_Email": null}], "gmember": [{"StudentID": "5196", "S_Name": "\u5f20\u6db5\u8d8a", "S_Nickname": "Alyssa", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "2", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5205", "S_Name": "\u738b\u5b50\u7444", "S_Nickname": "Shawn", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "1", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5089", "S_Name": "\u76db\u95fb\u96ea", "S_Nickname": "Grace", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "1", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4590", "S_Name": "\u6bdb\u99a8\u57f9", "S_Nickname": "April", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4524", "S_Name": "\u5cb3\u5143\u4ea8", "S_Nickname": "Henry", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4587", "S_Name": "\u9b4f\u8944\u797a", "S_Nickname": "Anna", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4605", "S_Name": "\u5468\u610f\u6b22", "S_Nickname": "Bob", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4541", "S_Name": "\u5218\u6995", "S_Nickname": "Ariel", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5720", "S_Name": "\u4fde\u8d8a", "S_Nickname": "George", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5286", "S_Name": "\u6587\u601d\u6db5", "S_Nickname": "Hellen", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5624", "S_Name": "\u9648\u4f9d\u7136", "S_Nickname": "Isabella", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5668", "S_Name": "\u9ad8\u6893\u59d7", "S_Nickname": "Yuki", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5591", "S_Name": "\u7f57\u5b87\u77f3", "S_Nickname": "Stevie", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5695", "S_Name": "\u6bdb\u6b23\u4e4b", "S_Nickname": "Ethan.Mao", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5597", "S_Name": "\u859b\u6167\u9e9f", "S_Nickname": "Kylie", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5619", "S_Name": "\u5f20\u6148", "S_Nickname": "Aurora", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5588", "S_Name": "\u6f58\u601d\u9f50", "S_Nickname": "Jerry", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4597", "S_Name": "\u6768\u6dc7\u5e06", "S_Nickname": "Selina", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4606", "S_Name": "\u9646\u6bc5\u8bda", "S_Nickname": "Eric", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5384", "S_Name": "\u90ed\u53ef\u6069", "S_Nickname": "Karen", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5396", "S_Name": "\u7ae0\u4f73\u61ff", "S_Nickname": "Sophia", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5382", "S_Name": "\u767d\u5a05\u94a6", "S_Nickname": "Ashley", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4617", "S_Name": "\u987e\u5929\u7fbd", "S_Nickname": "Marco", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5677", "S_Name": "\u6f58\u6625\u6656", "S_Nickname": "Dandy", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}], "grecord": [{"C_Theme": "10.14 English debate club activity 3 ", "C_Date": "2021-12-18 00:00:00", "C_Reflection": "Today, we held our third club meeting during the semester.

Luminosity Psychological Club will also organize the Mental Health Week outside the world in conjunction with the school's psychological room.\n       The vision of the Luminosity Psychology Club is not only at the level of psychological theory. We also hope to use the club as a medium to promote an academic spirit in the club and campus: the spirit of an inquirer, investigator and team member-diligence, enthusiasm, and focus. We hope that when we find like-minded peers, we can also provide students who are interested and passionate in psychology with an opportunity to continue to explore this magical field and pass on this academic spirit.\n"}], "supervisor": [{"TeacherID": "490", "T_Name": "\u4f55\u74a8", "T_Nickname": null, "T_MTel": "32048320001015194X", "T_Email": null}], "gmember": [{"StudentID": "5090", "S_Name": "\u6a0a\u4e00\u5e06", "S_Nickname": "Sherlin", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "2", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4498", "S_Name": "\u66f9\u6587\u8431", "S_Nickname": "Vivian", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "1", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5218", "S_Name": "\u5218\u5143\u9e92", "S_Nickname": "Richie", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4471", "S_Name": "\u5468\u626c\u626c", "S_Nickname": "Fenny", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5185", "S_Name": "\u82cf\u4fca\u540c", "S_Nickname": "Kevin Su", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5207", "S_Name": "\u8881\u5609\u4f1f", "S_Nickname": "David", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4628", "S_Name": "\u91d1\u683c\u5982", "S_Nickname": "Gloria", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4506", "S_Name": "\u5218\u601d\u5f64", "S_Nickname": "Grace", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4645", "S_Name": "\u5434\u5b87\u6b23", "S_Nickname": "Wendy", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5067", "S_Name": "\u6c88\u4f73\u6654", "S_Nickname": "Jay", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5226", "S_Name": "\u97e6\u5929\u4f9d", "S_Nickname": "Tina", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5855", "S_Name": "\u5415\u84e6", "S_Nickname": "moer", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5840", "S_Name": "\u5b59\u5929\u704f", "S_Nickname": "Thomas", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5687", "S_Name": "\u738b\u79cb\u5f64", "S_Nickname": "Lily", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5646", "S_Name": "\u65bd\u61ff\u5bb8", "S_Nickname": "Sandy", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5874", "S_Name": "\u9648\u96e8\u5f64", "S_Nickname": "Kathy", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "6020", "S_Name": "\u6c6a\u745e\u7426", "S_Nickname": "Cathy", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5831", "S_Name": "\u738b\u5fc3\u7fbd", "S_Nickname": "Celia", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5664", "S_Name": "\u8463\u66e6\u6587", "S_Nickname": "Delphine", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5575", "S_Name": "\u738b\u5357\u9526", "S_Nickname": "Annie", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5884", "S_Name": "\u53f6\u6c88\u6696\u9633", "S_Nickname": "Amy", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5644", "S_Name": "\u91d1\u827a\u7433", "S_Nickname": "Wendy", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5667", "S_Name": "\u51e4\u6816\u6850", "S_Nickname": "Asher", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5130", "S_Name": "\u53f6\u5586\u4eea", "S_Nickname": "Zoey", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "4557", "S_Name": "\u5f20\u6cfd\u5b87", "S_Nickname": "Rose", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}, {"StudentID": "5094", "S_Name": "\u738b\u73a5", "S_Nickname": "Cynthia", "S_STel": "", "S_Email": "", "LeaderYes": "0", "C_Secede": "0"}], "grecord": [{"C_Theme": "sharing the schools of psychology ", "C_Date": "2023-06-26 00:00:00", "C_Reflection": "This activity actually happened in the afternoon of April 24, 2023.

I\u2019m really looking forward to the following activities in Japanese club."}, {"C_Theme": "Icebreaking", "C_Date": "2023-12-01 00:00:00", "C_Reflection": "This activity actually happened on September 21, 2023. We have regular meeting today. Today, we held the first club activity. As the president of the club, I introduced the daily activities of the club in the future to them. I consulted the other club members for suggestions. I supplemented and adjusted the club activity plan. By playing sword jade ball, fencing and other activities, the members broke the ice among themselves.

But I think it's boring just to explain the plot. You can also go to see the play by yourself. So I'm preparing more about the culture behind the TV play. For example, this time, I have introduced three major themes through different TV series, focusing on the knowledge behind the three themes of \"Japanese campus violence\", \"Japanese police system\" and \"Japanese customs and culture\". Through data and real cases, I have described the dark side behind the Japanese campus, and through well-known plays like detective Conan, I have brought out the unique characteristics behind Japan Police system and so on, let us have a more understanding of Japanese culture."}, {"C_Theme": "The Introduction of Hokkaido, Kyushu and Chiba ", "C_Date": "2021-03-02 00:00:00", "C_Reflection": "This is the first activity in this semester, I introduced two remote areas in Japan: Hokkaido and Kyushu. To me, these two places are very special. They are not as international as big cities like Tokyo, but they are not as traditional Japanese as some small inland places. They are more like the embodiment of another national culture in Japan. I introduced the famous mayor of Hokkaido and his changes to Hokkaido. I also discussed with my classmates the advantages and disadvantages of his approach, and deeply analyzed the purpose behind a series of changes. Then, I think it's boring to introduce cities one by one, so I introduce various cities in Kyushu in the form of separate keywords. Some cities are known as Hawaii in the East, and some cities have very famous mascots. Each city has its unique and attractive place, which is worth exploring."}, {"C_Theme": "idol culture + ceremony", "C_Date": "2020-06-20 00:00:00", "C_Reflection": "The idol session is also very interesting as I know the whole structure of the different types of idol in Japan and some of the famous idols. We also watched the videos about their performance and we even learnt about the way fans would encourage and support their idols. It\u2019s a good preparation for my future study in Japan as this is one of the most important recreations, isn\u2019t it? \nAnother part of today's activity is we finally passed on the club to the new president and Vice President of HIBIKI. We hold a party and a ceremony to celebrate the perfect ending for this year's CAS activities all HIBKI members've participated in. Cheers for the future of HIBKI!\n"}], "projectyes": 1}, {"groups": [{"C_GroupsID": "124", "C_GroupNo": "500030", "C_NameC": "\u7269\u7406\u793e", "C_NameE": "Physics Society", "C_CategoryID": "5", "C_Category": "Academic", "C_TypeC": null, "C_TypeA": null, "C_TypeS": null, "C_FoundTime": "2017-10-20 20:42:23", "C_DescriptionC": "\u7269\u7406\u793e\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u5b66\u672f\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u6027\u548c\u8da3\u5473\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u77e5\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6316\u6398\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u81ea\u5df1\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u89c1\u5230\u6ee1\u9ed1\u677f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7ed3\u8bc6\u65b0\u4ea4\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5b66\u957f\u5b66\u59d0\u540c\u4eab\u7269\u7406\u4e50\u8da3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f60\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f53\u9a8c\u6d6a\u6f2b\uff0c\u611f\u53d7\u827a\u672f\uff0c\u4f53\u4f1a\u7269\u7406\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u4e07\u7269\u4e4b\u7f8e\u3002\u5728\u7269\u7406\u793e\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u53ef\u4ee5\u7545\u6240\u6b32\u8a00\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5929\u9a6c\u884c\u7a7a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8086\u610f\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u5149\uff0c\u7167\u8fdb\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u6bcf\u4e00\u4f4d\u524d\u884c\u8005\u7684\u5230\u6765\uff01", "C_DescriptionE": "Physics society aimed to increase the universality of academy and the enjoyment brought by learning physics.

This may be the largest field, ranging from the study of a single nerve cell (single neuron research in some cognitive experiments) to social cognition, although social psychology It also studies social cognition, but because of the different research perspectives, it is different from social psychology), can be regarded as the scope of cognitive psychology. However, it should be noted that the distinction between cognitive psychologists and other psychologists should be different from the research question. The research scope of cognitive psychology probably includes, perception, memory, attention, language, thinking, (including logic , Speculation, mathematics, causality, etc.), problem solving, and social cognition (such as mind theory, etc.). To some extent, cognitive neuroscience is included in cognitive psychology, but cognitive neuroscientists ask different questions from other cognitive psychologists: they may want to understand how a cognitive process is Shown in the brain, including the spatial position of the brain (not a one-to-one mapping of a cognitive process and a certain brain area), temporal changes in the brain's active area and/or changes in neuronal dynamics in physiology and electricity , And the white matter connections between different brain regions. So it can be said that cognitive neuroscience wants to understand the mechanism of all cognitive processes by observing the activity of the brain at close range, and other psychologists who only conduct behavioral experiments may temporarily ignore the activity of the brain and develop through behavioral experiments. Theory, and then it is possible to explore whether such a theory can be supported by neuroscience experiments. So I think it can be considered that the problems of cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology research are very similar, except that one is from bottom to top, and the other is from top to bottom, digging through the \"channel\" to study the human brain and cognition. Another point to add is that with the development of cognitive science, more and more people use computational models to study many cognitive problems, such as the currently popular Bayesian model (Bayesian modeling).

In the section of \"transcendental perceptual theory\" in Critique of Pure Reason, Kant believes that sensibility is the sensory ability of the subject, while time and space are the innate intuitive forms of sensibility, and color and smell are the acquired intuitive materials of sensibility. Time is introspective, space is external, and external ultimately belongs to introspective, so time is slightly higher than space. Time gave birth to algebra and space to geometry. Time and space are subjective, not objective.

Famous science fiction works such as \"The Three Body Problem\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" will become the main focus of monograph research in the club activities. We will also discuss the different forms of science fiction culture in the society. Finally, every member of the club will have the opportunity to practice in person and apply their learnt knowledge to their own creations, including but not limited to producing short sci-fi clips, fan writings, and even novels.

used in internal combustion engines, such as cars and motorcycles. It is separated from petroleum during the refining process and is a high energy density fuel suitable for high-speed, efficient engines.\n\nDiesel: Diesel is also a liquid fuel that is widely used in diesel engines, such as trucks, buses, and generators. It has a high energy density, efficient power output and fuel economy.\n\nNatural Gas: Natural gas is a clean fossil fuel, mainly composed of methane. It is used in the automotive and industrial sectors for power generation, heating and fuel supply, reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBiofuels (Biofuels) : Biofuels are fuels made from organic materials, including biodiesel and ethanol. They are usually produced from raw materials such as vegetable oil, cooking oil, waste, etc., and are environmentally friendly and renewable.\n\nApplications of bioengineering in fuels:\n\nBioengineering has a wide range of applications in the fuel sector, aiming to reduce dependence on traditional petroleum fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and drive the development of sustainable energy sources:\n\nBiodiesel: Through bioengineering techniques, biodiesel can be produced using vegetable oils, algae or waste animal and plant oils. This diesel can be used in conventional diesel engines to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nBioethanol: Bioengineering can be used to produce ethanol, usually by fermentation of crops such as corn or sugar cane. Bioethanol can be blended with gasoline, reducing the need for oil and reducing tailpipe emissions.\n\nBioengineering can be used to produce biogas, which produces methane gas by breaking down organic waste, such as agricultural residues or municipal waste, by microorganisms.\n\nAlgae fuel: Bioengineering research is using algae to produce fuel, which has the advantage of high productivity and low land requirements and is expected to be an important source of sustainable fuel in the future."}, {"C_Theme": "Core work for the semester", "C_Date": "2024-01-03 00:00:00", "C_Reflection": "Overall activity planning for a semester.
