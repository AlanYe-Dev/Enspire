console.warn('You are importing your Prisma Client from the wrong path, please follow these steps:\n\n\n1. At the root of this project (or package), get the relative path to your client.\nFor example, that could be `../prisma/client` or `./client` or something similar.\n\n\n2. Once you know where your client is located, add your own client as a dependency.\n - For npm, run `npm add db@./path/to/your/client`\n - For pnpm, run `pnpm add db@link:./path/to/your/client`\n - For yarn, run `yarn add db@link:./path/to/your/client`\n\n\n3. If you have a `tsconfig.json`, set `moduleResolution` to `node16`, `nodenext`, or `bundler`.\nAlternatively, if you prefer, setting `module` to `node16` or `nodenext` equally works.\n\n\n4. Your client is now properly setup. To suppress this warning, update your imports.\n```\nimport { PrismaClient } from "db"\n```\n\n\nMore information: https://pris.ly/d/custom-output')
